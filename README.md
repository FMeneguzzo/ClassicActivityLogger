# ClassicActivityLogger
Simple addon to store specific WoW Classic activities into the saved variables files

Note: it is important to empty the saved variables manually/via script every now and then or the file might grow too large and cause in-game inconveniences.
Heartbeat logs and PLAYER_MONEY events can be disabled to have a lighter log file.
